# Regira Consumer Project

Read `ai/AGENTS.md` (or `.github/instructions/regira/` if guides have been extracted) before taking any action. It is the authoritative routing guide for all code generation, package selection, and project scaffolding.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Never guess** — do not invent namespaces, method signatures, or package names. Stop and ask.
2. **Run the pre-flight checklist** in `ai/AGENTS.md` before generating any code.
3. **Load the relevant guide first** — do not write application code before reading the applicable `*.instructions.md` file.

## Slash commands

If Regira slash commands have been extracted to `.claude/commands/`, the following are available:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/new-project` | Bootstrap a new consumer project (template → packages → restore/build → checkpoint) |
| `/new-entity` | Scaffold a complete Regira entity with full CRUD |
| `/sync-guides` | Detect and refresh stale extracted guides in `.github/instructions/regira/` |
| `/update-guide` | Propose guide patches after a code change |
| `/evaluate` | Run a structured code quality evaluation for a module |
