# Shared Setup for Regira AI Instructions

> **Role:** Load this file for setup rules reused by multiple module guides and for consumer-guide sync or distribution mechanics.
>
> **Boundaries:** Use [`AGENTS.md`](../../../ai/AGENTS.md) for module discovery, top-level routing, and the execution-oriented consumer workflow. Use [`project.setup.md`](./project.setup.md) for project-template choice and baseline app shape.

Use this file when a module guide needs shared setup without repeating it.

## NuGet Feed

Regira packages are published at `https://packages.regira.com/v3/index.json`. Add this feed to `NuGet.Config` alongside `nuget.org`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="NuGet" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="Regira" value="https://packages.regira.com/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

## Consumer Local Guides

- **Source repository**: the full `ai/` folder is available locally, so this file can point to adjacent guides.
- **Consumer project**: the normal entrypoint is `./AGENTS.md`; extracted `.github/instructions/regira/*.md` files are optional local guidance.

Keep these responsibilities separate in consumer projects:

- `./AGENTS.md` decides project template, module selection, package routing, and when extracted local guides must be read before code generation.
- `.github/instructions/regira/*.md` are optional local guides created by package extraction.
- `Regira.Setup` is the package path for extracting the shared setup guides `project.setup.md` and `shared.setup.md` during build.
- Module packages that ship AI files can extract their own module-specific guides during build through their package targets.
- `project.setup.md` stays focused on template selection and baseline app shape.
- `shared.setup.md` stays focused on setup rules reused across modules and local guide extraction behavior.

Consumers do not need the source-repository `ai/` folder for the normal one-file flow. Install `Regira.Setup` when the shared setup guides should be extracted locally through package restore and build.

## Authoring Rules

When adding new instruction files:

1. Put shared setup here if more than one module needs it.
2. Keep module guides focused on routing, decision rules, pitfalls, and package-specific behavior.
3. Put examples, setup walkthroughs, and exact signatures in separate deep-reference files.
4. Do not duplicate the module catalog or project-template tables here.
